AutoIt is a Windows window-manipulation language.

These scripts were developed for automating application installation on Windows XP, Service Pack 2 (roughly 2006)

Push buttons, interact with windows, move the mouse, etc all using straight-forward language. You can make GUIs too but they aren't as easy. I use AutoIt mainly for program installation (automatted, combined with a .cmd script = consistant installs).
